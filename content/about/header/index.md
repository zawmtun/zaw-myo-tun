<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am an epidemiologist with a keen interest in infectious diseases, particularly in tuberculosis. I received my medical degree in Myanmar and a MSc in epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. I use R avidly in my data analyses. Currently, I am based in Singapore pursuing a PhD in public health.
