<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am an epidemiologist with a keen interest in infectious diseases. I have worked on Tuberculosis, HIV, and COVID. I received my medical degree in Myanmar and a MSc in epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Currently, I am based in Singapore pursuing a PhD in public health.

I am passionate about data driven programming. I use R avidly in my data analyses. I am particularly interested in workflows involving both R and Excel as I work with many people who use Excel as their primary data tool.
